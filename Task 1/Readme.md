# Task 1: Make a GET API call

## Setup Instructions
No setup is required for this task.

## How to run the code
1. Save the code in a file, for example `Taskl.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Run the command `python Task1.py`.

## Observations
The code makes a GET request to the endpoint `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` and prints the response in JSON format. If the response status code is not 200, it prints a message indicating the failure with the status code. This code can be used as a starting point for making API calls in Python using the `requests` library.
